                  Stoner is a novel that allows you to completely immerse
                  yourself in its mundaneness—in the best way possible. This
                  drama, although short, is developed through prose that creates
                  a strong connection to William Stoner, the protagonist. You
                  feel what he feels, both the highs and the lows. Nothing
                  traditionally “exciting” drives you to keep turning the pages;
                  rather, it is the depth of the character, the early
                  twentieth-century Missouri countryside in which he lives, and
                  his exploration of love in all its forms.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This theme of love ultimately envelops the reader. Williams
                  puts the protagonist through many realistic trials and
                  tribulations, but what sustains him—though never explicitly
                  stated—is his love for his work and the people in his life.
                  This is a beautiful novel, and the ending evoked emotion as if
                  I had truly known Stoner.

                <p>
                  The plot of this book is one of the most unique and unsettling
                  stories I’ve read. Without getting too deep into the details,
                  the strange, labyrinth-like world that the reader is thrown
                  into immediately adds a lot of complexity. I went into this
                  novel completely blind, and for the first eighty pages I was
                  genuinely confused about what was happening. After that point,
                  though, the story shifts, and you start to understand the
                  world slightly faster than the protagonist as he slowly pieces
                  things together himself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I’m used to being able to visualize a novel’s setting clearly
                  and track where characters are at all times, but Piranesi
                  intentionally doesn’t allow for that. There’s no map and no
                  clear way to picture the space, which makes it difficult to
                  fully grasp where the character is physically. Instead of
                  being frustrating, this actually pulls you further into the
                  story. Piranesi is mentally lost but completely familiar with
                  the labyrinth, while the reader understands what’s happening
                  to him but remains lost within the space itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Spoiler alert: The ending, especially the cult-like situation
                  Piranesi becomes involved in, was unexpected but felt
                  appropriately developed given the direction of the story.
                  Piranesi ended up becoming one of my favorite literary
                  characters because of his optimism and gratitude toward the
                  world he lives in—qualities that stood out strongly and felt
                  genuinely meaningful.

                  Overall, this book had significant potential due to its
                  inventive plot, however, I found that the ending ultimately
                  fell somewhat flat. The novel follows a group of thieves who
                  steal from the city's nobility; through layers of elaborate
                  deception, they operate as highly sophisticated con artists.
                  While this concept was engaging, I was dissatisfied with the
                  motivations of the antagonist, the Grey King, which were not
                  revealed until the very end of the novel. Although these
                  motives were technically unpredictable, they felt
                  underdeveloped and somewhat contrived, as if they lacked a
                  clear foundation throughout the story. As a result, the climax
                  gave the impression that the resolution had not been
                  thoroughly thought through. While the novel avoids a
                  stereotypical "happy ending," I believe the conclusion could
                  have been executed more effectively to better match the
                  strength of the earlier narrative.
